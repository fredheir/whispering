## About

Whispering is an open-source transcription application that provides global speech-to-text functionality, with options such as keyboard shortcuts and automatic copy and paste to make dictating as seamless as possible.

Under the hood, it's powered by OpenAI's Whisper model, making it significantly more accurate than built-in dictation.

> **Important Note**: Whispering is designed primarily as a transcription tool, not a recording tool. For longer recordings where reliability is crucial, I recommend using a dedicated recording app on your phone or device that utilizes native recording APIs. This ensures optimal audio quality and recording stability.


### Whispering - Electron App

This is the Electron version of the Whispering application, converted from Tauri.

## Features

- Desktop application for recording, transcribing, and transforming audio
- Built with Svelte/SvelteKit and Electron
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Seamless Tauri-to-Electron compatibility layer

See the [README.md](README.md) for details

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7934f1f-d08b-4037-9bbc-aadd1b13501e

## Key Features

1. **Global Transcription**: Access Whisper's speech-to-text functionality anywhere with a global keyboard shortcut or within two button clicks.
2. **Cross-Platform Experience**:
   - Desktop App: Enables global transcription across all applications.
   - Browser Extension: Provides global transcription in the browser by communicating with the web app.
3. **Chat Integration**: The browser extension adds a recording button to ChatGPT and Claude websites, allowing direct voice input and transcription in the chat interface.
4. **Transcription Management**: Review and edit transcriptions within the Whispering app to ensure accuracy and clarity.
5. **Automatic Clipboard Integration**: Once transcription is complete, the text is automatically copied to your clipboard. An option for automatic pasting is also available.

## How is my data stored?

Whispering stores as much data as possible locally on your device, including recordings and text transcriptions. This approach ensures maximum privacy and data security. Here's an overview of how data is handled:

1. **Local Storage**: Voice recordings and transcriptions are stored in IndexedDB, which is used as a blob storage and a place to store all of your data like text and transcriptions.

2. **Transcription Service**: The only data sent elsewhere is your recording to an external transcription serviceâ€”if you choose one. You have the following options:
   - External services like OpenAI or Groq
   - A local transcription service such as `faster-whisper-server`, which keeps everything on-device

3. **Configurable Settings**: You can change the transcription service in the settings to ensure maximum local functionality.

## Usage

### Chrome Extension

After installing the Chrome Extension, you will find a Whispering icon on the Chrome extensions bar. Click on this icon to open the extension. Click the microphone button to record your voice, and then click the square button when you're done. Your transcription will appear in the text box below.

To access the ChatGPT or Claude feature, navigate to the ChatGPT or Claude web page. You'll see a new recording button in the chat interface. Click this button to start and stop recording, and the transcribed text will be automatically inserted into the chat input field.

To access the shortcut feature, press <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> (later configurable through Chrome extension shortcuts) to start recording from any website. The transcription will be automatically copied into your clipboard and paste into the current input field.

The Chrome Extension communicates with [whispering.bradenwong.com](https://whispering.bradenwong.com), and will automatically attempt to create a tab in the background if it does not find one. Most bugs can be attributed to this communication failing, such as rare instances where the tab falls asleep.

### Web App

The web app is accessible via [whispering.bradenwong.com](https://whispering.bradenwong.com). Click the microphone button to record your voice, and then click the square button when you're done. Your transcription will appear in the text box.

### Desktop App

After installing the Whispering desktop app, press <kbd>Control/Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>;</kbd> (configurable in settings) to start recording from anywhere on your desktop. The transcription will be automatically copied into your clipboard and pasted, though both features can be toggled in the settings.

## Built With

#### Web and Desktop

The Whispering app is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev): The UI reactivity library of choice.
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs): For routing and static site generation, used for making both the website and the static frontend for the Tauri app.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/intro/): The desktop app framework.
- [Effect-TS](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect): To sprinkle some functional programming and write extremely type-safe functions, where errors are included in the return type of the function signature.
- [Svelte Sonner](https://svelte-sonner.vercel.app/): A simple, customizable toast library for Svelte applications. Used to capture and display errors bubbled up via Effect-TS using the `renderAsToast` function.
- [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table): To power all data tables.
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API): A low-level API for storing large amounts of structured data in the browser. Synchronized with Tanstack Table.

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/): For monorepo management, so that `apps/app` and `apps/extension` can share the same codebase, drastically reducing code duplication and more importantly, keeping a single source of truth.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org): For extending desktop app features, such as using the `enigo` crate for handling automatic pasting.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Hosting that's decent for a hobby project and has nice Turborepo integrations.
- [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/): A royalty-free sound effects library.

#### Extension

The Whispering Chrome extension is built using:

- [Effect-TS](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect): To sprinkle some functional programming and write extremely type-safe functions, where errors are included in the return type of the function signature.
- [React](https://reactjs.org): The UI reactivity library for the Chrome extension, as Plasmo unfortunately doesn't support Svelte 5.
- [ShadCN](https://github.com/shadcn): The UI component library for the Chrome extension.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

1. Change into the extension directory: `cd apps/extension`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pnpm i`
3. Run Plasmo build: `pnpm plasmo build --target=chrome-mv3`
4. Output should be found in `apps/extension/build/chrome-mv3-prod`, which can be loaded into Chrome as an unpacked extension.
5. Alternatively, you can build the extension for the Chrome Web Store: `pnpm plasmo build --target=chrome-mv3 --release`

### Firefox

1. Change into the extension directory: `cd apps/extension`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pnpm i`
3. Run Plasmo build: `pnpm plasmo build --target=firefox-mv3`
4. Output should be found in `apps/extension/build/firefox-mv3-prod`, which can be loaded into Chrome as an unpacked extension.
5. Alternatively, you can build the extension for the Chrome Web Store: `pnpm plasmo build --target=firefox-mv3 --release`

### Desktop

1. Change into the app directory: `cd apps/app`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pnpm i`
